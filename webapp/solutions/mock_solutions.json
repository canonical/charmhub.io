    "long_description": "The Canonical Observability Stack (COS) is a highly-integrated, low-operations observability stack powered by Juju and Kubernetes. It gathers, processes, visualizes, and alerts on telemetry generated by workloads running both within and outside of Juju environments.\n\nBy leveraging the topology model of Juju to contextualize the data, and charm relations to automate configuration and integration, it provides a low-ops observability suite based on best-in-class, open-source observability tools.\n\nFor Site Reliability Engineers, COS provides a turn-key, out-of-the-box solution for improved day-2 operational insight.",
    "use_cases": [
        { "Enterprise Application Monitoring": "Organizations deploying complex enterprise applications can gain immediate visibility into system performance and health. COS automatically discovers application components through Juju topology, providing contextual monitoring that understands service relationships." },
        { "Kubernetes Infrastructure Observability": "For teams running workloads on Kubernetes, COS provides comprehensive visibility into cluster health, resource utilization, and application performance. The tight integration with MicroK8s makes it particularly effective for monitoring Canonical Kubernetes deployments." },
        { "Hybrid Infrastructure Monitoring": "Organizations with mixed infrastructure environments (VMs, containers, bare metal) can use COS to create a unified observability solution. Through the COS Proxy and Grafana Agent components, the stack can collect telemetry from non-Juju workloads and legacy applications." }
