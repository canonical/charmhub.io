![Github Actions Status](https://github.com/canonical-web-and-design/charmhub.io/workflows/PR%20checks/badge.svg?branch=main) [![Code coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/canonical-web-and-design/charmhub.io/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/canonical-web-and-design/charmhub.io)

A charm is a software package that bundles an operator together with metadata that supports the integration of many operators in a coherent aggregated system.

An operator packaged as a charm means that it is configured, operated and integrated in a standard way regardless of the vendor or the application. Charms enable multi-vendor operator collections with standardised behaviours, reducing the learning curve associated with each operator and creating richer application ecosystems.

This repo is the application for the [charmhub.io](https://charmhub.io) website.

The site is largely maintained by the [Web and Design team](https://ubuntu.com/blog/topics/design) at [Canonical](https://www.canonical.com). It is a stateless website project based on [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) and hosted on a [Charmed Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes) cluster.


## Bugs and issues

If you have found a bug on the site or have an idea for a new feature, feel free to [create a new issue](https://github.com/canonical-web-and-design/charmhub.io/issues/new), or suggest a fix by [creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/). You can also find a link to create issues in the footer of every page of the site itself.


## Local development

The simplest way to run the site locally is using the [`dotrun`](https://snapcraft.io/dotrun) snap:

```bash
dotrun
```

Once the server has started, you can visit <http://127.0.0.1:8045> in your browser. You can stop the server using `<ctrl>+c`.
